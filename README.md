## Running instructions
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
python3 main.py
```
NOTE: You will need python 3.7+ to run the code. 

## Development setup
We tested our implementation on two machines - Google Colab and a machine with the following specifications - 
```
CPU: AMD 3900X processor (12 cores/ 24 threads)
GPU: Nvidia  RTX  2070  Super
8GB  dedicated  memory
32GB of shared memory
Memory: 64GB Ram
```

## Dataset

<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html">Titanic dataset obtained from Stanford</a>

The code implemented performed a binary classification task on the Titanic dataset to figure out which passenger survived the sinking.
